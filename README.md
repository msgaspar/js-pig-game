# Pig Game

Pig is a simple dice game first described by [John Scarne in 1945](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)>). Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

This is an implementation of the Pig game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, created as a challenge for learning and practicing JS programming and Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation.

Challenge proposed by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann), who is also responsible for the design.
